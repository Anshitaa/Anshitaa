### About Me

I am a Data Science graduate student at ASU with research experience in deep learning, NLP, and explainable AI. My work focuses on building transparent and high-impact AI models for time-series and natural language domains using tools like PyTorch, TensorFlow, and SHAP. I am passionate about the entire MLOps lifecycle, from developing scalable data pipelines with Spark and Kafka to deploying containerized applications with Docker and Kubernetes.
